# Ruby Â» <br> Vital signs logger for Ruby

* Doc: <http://sixarm.com/sixarm_ruby_vital/doc>
* Gem: <http://rubygems.org/gems/sixarm_ruby_vital>

## Introduction

Vital has several methods to help with Ruby's typical logger.

The methods automatically prepend helpful debugging information 
to each log message:

  * timestamp
  * class name
  * method name
  * process information
  * the original message

The methods log using tab separated values, which make the
log files easier to parse in our other tools (i.e. awk).
